# Alternative runfiles library for Go

This package contains an alternative runfiles library for
[`rules_go`][rules_go].  This library follows the [runfiles libraries
proposal][] more closely.  In particular, it requires specifying a workspace
name for runfile paths, and handles the case where no runfiles-specific
environmental variables are set correctly.  You can use both this library and
the [official Bazel library][] in the same program or library; they donâ€™t
interfere with each other.

See the [Go package documentation][] for instructions how to use this package.
